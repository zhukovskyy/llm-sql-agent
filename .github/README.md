# 🚀 GitHub Actions Auto-Deploy Setup

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to production.

## 🔧 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Add GitHub Secrets

Go to: **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

Add these 4 secrets:

| Secret Name | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key | `sk-proj-...` |
| `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` | SQL Server connection string | `Server=...` |
| `DEPLOY_USERNAME` | Web Deploy username | `DOMAIN\Username` |
| `DEPLOY_PASSWORD` | Web Deploy password | `your_password` |

### 2. That's it! 🎉

Now every time you push to `main`, your app will automatically deploy!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
```

Watch the deployment: [Actions Tab](../../actions)
